<h1> Data Science Journey </h1>
I created this Github page on 27.10.2022 in order to track my data science project. <br>
This page would contain 2 branches; one for my IBM projects, and the other for my python projects <br>
In the future, more branches would be created as I learn more programmes, such as R and SQL <br>
Finally, as I acquire my skills, updates would be made accordingle on the github files <br>
<br>

Thank you<br>
